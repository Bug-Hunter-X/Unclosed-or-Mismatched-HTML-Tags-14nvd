<p>This is a corrected version of the HTML code.  The closing tags now correctly match the opening tags, resulting in proper rendering.</p><p>The following is an example of correctly nested and closed tags:</p><code>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is a div.&lt;/div&gt;</code><p>Notice how each opening tag has a corresponding closing tag, and nested tags are properly nested.</p><p>Always validate your HTML to catch these errors early in development. Many online validators can help you identify and fix issues before they impact your website's functionality and appearance.</p>
